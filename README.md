# Shrewdeye Bash CLI 🚀

## What is Shrewdeye Bash?
Shrewdeye is a user-friendly UI tool available at [shrewdeye.app](https://shrewdeye.app/), designed to streamline the subdomain enumeration process for Security Researchers. Leveraging the power of [amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass), [subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder), and [assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder) tools, Shrewdeye consistently delivers excellent results for comprehensive subdomain testing.

I find their services highly effective, providing me with accurate and quick results for testing purposes.

The accompanying bash script is incredibly simple to use. Just clone the repository and run the script:

## Usage

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tess-ss/shrewdeye-bash.git
 bash shrewdeye.sh
 Do you want to input a single domain or provide a list? (single/list): list
 Enter the domain name: bugcrowd.com hackerone.com
 Data for hackerone.com saved to hackerone.com_output.txt
 Data for bugcrowd.com saved to bugcrowd.com_output.txt
```

Enjoy streamlined subdomain enumeration!
